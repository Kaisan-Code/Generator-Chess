Generator Chess is a custom variant (of Chess) that I have invented.

The goal is the same as normal chess: Checkmate the opponent's King.

Generator Chess Rules:
1. On your turn, you may chose to play a _normal move_, or a _regeneration move_.
2. If regenerating, then you can place a **captured piece** on its starting square if it's unoccupied.
3. The captured piece has to be one of **your** pieces, not your opponents ones.
4. Pieces captured on the _opponent's_ **last turn** cannot be regenerated.
5. You _cannot_ regenerate a piece if the **initial amount** of it is already on the board.
6. In total, you get **5 regenerations** per game.
